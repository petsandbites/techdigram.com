# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to automatically generate architecture diagrams using LLM prompting. Users provide their ChatGPT API key/token and describe their system architecture through natural language prompts. The application generates PlantUML code and renders it as visual diagrams in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input my ChatGPT API key, so that I can authenticate and use the LLM service for diagram generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display an API key input field
2. WHEN the user enters a valid ChatGPT API key THEN the system SHALL store it securely for the session
3. WHEN the user enters an invalid API key THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. IF no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL prevent access to diagram generation features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to describe my system architecture in natural language, so that I can generate diagrams without learning PlantUML syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has a valid API key THEN the system SHALL display a text input area for prompts
2. WHEN the user enters a system description THEN the system SHALL accept multi-line text input
3. WHEN the user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL send it to the ChatGPT API for processing
4. IF the prompt is empty THEN the system SHALL display a validation message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the generated PlantUML code, so that I can understand and modify the diagram structure if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM generates a response THEN the system SHALL extract PlantUML code from the response
2. WHEN PlantUML code is available THEN the system SHALL display it in a code editor with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN the user modifies the PlantUML code THEN the system SHALL allow real-time editing
4. IF no valid PlantUML is generated THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the rendered diagram visualization, so that I can view the final architecture diagram.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid PlantUML code is available THEN the system SHALL render it as a visual diagram
2. WHEN the PlantUML code changes THEN the system SHALL update the rendered diagram automatically
3. WHEN rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display error details to help debugging
4. WHEN rendering succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the diagram with zoom and pan capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my diagrams, so that I can use them in documentation or presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diagram is successfully rendered THEN the system SHALL provide export options
2. WHEN the user clicks export THEN the system SHALL offer multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
3. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL download the file to the user's device
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load my diagram projects, so that I can work on multiple diagrams over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a diagram THEN the system SHALL provide save functionality
2. WHEN the user saves a project THEN the system SHALL store the prompt, PlantUML code, and metadata
3. WHEN the user loads a project THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state including rendered diagram
4. WHEN the user manages projects THEN the system SHALL provide list, rename, and delete operations
